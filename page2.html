     Rosario is a middle aged latina raising 6 children with her husband. She has always rented houses since she came from Mexico almost 20 years ago. When asked if she had ever experienced discrimination from a landlord she recalled an instance that occured years ago.  
    </p>
          
    <h2>Have you ever experienced any discrimination in the renting process?</h2>
    

        <p>"We were living in a house that was in a pretty dangerous low-income area. My brother fell into a rough patch and he was staying with us in the basement until he was able to land on his feet. When our landlord found out he was furious and told us we had to pay more in the rent or leave."  
        </p>
          
          <p>Rosario goes on to talk about how the landlord, a white male, took their month's rent which they expected meant they would have some time to get packed and find a new place.  </p>
          
          <p>"We discovered he had walked into our house while we werent home, and without notice, to show it to potential tenants. When we complained he said we had until the end of the week. I thought he was going to start throwing our furniture out the window thats how angry he got but because I was pregnant with my second child, we didnt want to make a big deal out of it so we left." 
          </p>

 <h2>Did you take legal action?</h2>
    
<p>"No, we just thought it would be too much of a hassle and we really didnt have the money to talk to an attorney. The best solution was to just leave."
     </p>
          <p>Rosario and her husband are mexican immigrants and do not speak enlish. When I asked her why she thought she couldn't find help she said...</p>
          
          <p>"Well to be honest many of us are too scared. We avoid any contact with the police in fear of deportation, we cant communicate efficiently, and even if we can we just dont have the money or resources. It's better to just move on."</p>
