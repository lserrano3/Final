     Jeliah is a young adult black male who has grown up his entire life in the Chicago suburbs. When asked if he had ever experienced discrimination in housing her had this to say...  
    </p>

 <h2>Have you ever experienced any discrimination in the renting or housing process?</h2>
    
<p>
  "I personally have never experienced it, but I know plenty of people of color that were looking to be homeowners with all the necessary requirements to own it and have still been discriminated against."</p>
    

 <h2>Why do you think that is?</h2>
    
<p>
     "It's more about the banks and their ability to deny loans for property. Like they'd have the credit, the moeny, and have proven they can manage their money and have still been denied"
    
<p>He takes a moment before continuing. "I don't like to think it's because of the color of their skin, but it's hard not to see it that way when someone with the same income, and credit with the only difference being that they're white having a better chance of becoming a home owner."</p>
