    <p>Since the 70s, the Department of Housing and Urban Development has conducted research into racial and ethnic discrimination in both rental and sales markets. They observed 28 metropolitan areas every decade by using a method of paired testing. This method compares how two people, of the same qualifications, are treated in the same tasks. The experiment compared how blacks, hispanics, and asians compare to equally qualified white participants in the following categories:
        
            <li>Making appointments</li>
            <li>In-person visits</li>
            <li>Inspect homes/apartments</li>
         </p>
    
       <p>The results from the most recent 2012 study found that in the process of renting, minority renters are told about and shown fewer homes and apartments than equally qualified whites. Results also did not suggest one region was more or less discriminatory than another which concludes this is a national issue.  </p>

       <h2>So what does this mean?</h2>
    <p> It means that the policies and laws we have in place need to continue to adapt in order to address the patterns of discrimination that we continue to see to this day. It also means we must pinpoint the smaller details to fix. To get a better understanding of what discrimination looked like in the smaller details, I spoke with 3 individuals of my community. The biggest takeaways were not shocking but rather became evidence of what I had learned from my previous research and this course. Not only are we still seeing discrimination in the lending process for poc but that barriers such as the inability to understand the language (legal or English), as well as the threat of police brutality and deportation are big factors in why many of these cases go un reported. </p>
